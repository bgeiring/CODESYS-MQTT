# JSON
- new library for easy use with JSON/zigbee2mqtt:

https://github.com/stefandreyer/CODESYS-zigbee2mqtt

# BENEFITS
- very fast, every received paket is deivierd to application in the cycle it was received
- in out of the box configuration, 50 pakets can be transmittet in on cycle in QoS 0
- very powerfull integration due calllbacks
- multibroker support

# New Version 1.2.0.1
- solved some reliable issues
- added supervison FB, monitor your MQTT client with MQTT
- changed namespace
- addad any support for publish
- solved wrong payload delivery to application with big pakets
- changed name of HANDLE_MQTT to MQTTClient
- changed call of MQTTClient, do only call nested in MQTT_IN_OUT instance
- added suport of nested subscriber, client can return reference to a dynamic created subscriber instance
- changed type types to Base Interfaces TypeClass for any support
- replaced some librarys with placeholders for better intigration support
- QoS channel size and History size can now be configurated
- changed many pointers to references
- done some conventional naming stuff



# NEW Example!
- please have a look in the GreatExampleOfAdvantages!
- it runs out of the box with test.mosquitto.org
- there look into MyProperty programm
- it shows you how to never ever again tipp any topic in you program!
- have fun!!!

# NEWS
- 64bit support, but you need to enable dynamic memory allocation
- much faster testHighReciveSplitPayload() works with nearly 600 sends, recives per second!

# subscription now works with new approach

- now is done with callbacks
- see the TestMQTTGithubInterfaceExampleTopicAndPayload examples, there you can see the benefits.
You can publish direkt to the instance and variable name, and the lib is doing the rest
have fun!
